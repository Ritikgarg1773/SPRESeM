# SPRESeM
SPRESeM is a small javascript based program developed on the google Speech Recognition Script which runs with Google Chrome.
SPRESeM stands for Speech REcognition Scoring systEM and what it does can be explained with an example.
In the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the last scene when all the houses are gathered in the great hall and it was time to announce the winner of the HOUSE CUP. 
Dumbledore assigns few last minute points to the three lead characters and Neville. What this brought to my mind that either their's a highly sophisticated technological system behind all this setup or some magical stuff.
So what if we present to you somewhat of a very basic replica of the same technology that might be running.

Spresem currently uses 4 teams assigned names of colors as they are easily recoganised by the speech engine.
So you can try your hands with commands like: 
  TEAM RED GETS 10 POINTS, 
  TEAM GREEN LOSES 10 POINTS, 
  TEAM BROWN WINS 40 POINTS, 
and so on
Currently we do get a few glitches but we are working on it and this was made for fun hopefully someone outhere might like to use it for some project of their own and we would be quite happy to get some acknowledgement and suggestions.

You can run our program on the following webpage:
